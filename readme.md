Welcome to the "Book Recommender System" project! This collaborative recommender system uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to recommend books based on user preferences. Explore new books you'll love!

## About This Project

### What is a Recommender System?

Recommender systems are a type of software application that provide personalized recommendations to users. These recommendations are based on user behavior and preferences. The "Book Recommender System" is a collaborative recommender system, which means it provides recommendations by finding users who are similar to you and suggesting books that they have liked.

### How Does It Work?

The "Book Recommender System" uses a powerful algorithm called K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). This algorithm finds books similar to the ones you've liked by analyzing the preferences of other users. It takes into account the ratings and reviews you've provided and finds books with similar ratings from other users. The more you rate and review books, the more accurate the recommendations become.
